# Local Relayer

## What is LocalOsmosis?

LocalOsmosis (a fork of LocalTerra) is a complete Osmosis testnet and ecosystem containerized with Docker and orchestrated with a simple `docker-compose` file. It simplifies the way smart-contract developers test their contracts in a sandbox before they deploy them on a testnet or mainnet.

LocalOsmosis comes preconfigured with opinionated, sensible defaults for standard testing environments. If other projects mention testing on LocalOsmosis, they are referring to the settings defined in this repo.

LocalOsmosis has the following advantages over a public testnet:

- Easily modifiable world states
- Quick to reset for rapid iterations
- Simple simulations of different scenarios
- Controllable validator behavior

## Prerequisites

- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- [`Osmosisd`](https://get.osmosis.zone)
  * Select option 3 (localosmosis), the installer will configure everything for you. 
  * The osmosisd dameon on your local computer is used to communicate with the localosmosis daemin running inside the Docker container. 
- Supported known architecture: x86_64
- 16+ GB of RAM is recommended

## Install LocalOsmosis

1. Run the following commands::

```sh
git clone https://github.com/osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis.git
cd LocalOsmosis
```

2. Make sure your Docker daemon is running in the background and [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose) is installed.

If running on linux, you can install these tools with the following commands:

- docker
```
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```
- docker-compose
```
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

## Start, stop, and reset LocalOsmosis

- Start LocalOsmosis:

```sh
make start
```

Your environment now contains:

- [osmosisd](http://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis) RPC node running on `tcp://localhost:26657`
- LCD running on http://localhost:1317


Stop LocalOsmosis (and retain chain data):

```sh
make stop
```

Stop LocalOsmosis (and delete chain data):

```sh
make restart
```

## Integrations

### osmosisd

1. Ensure the same version of `osmosisd` is present in your local computer and LocalOsmosis Docker container. You can check the version of localosmosis by checking the image in the docker-compose.yml file and the version of your osmosisd on your local machine with `osmosisd version`

2. Use `osmosisd` from your local machine to talk to your LocalOsmosis `osmosisd` node:

```sh
osmosisd status
```

This command automatically works because `osmosisd` connects to `localhost:26657` by default.

The following command is the explicit form:
```sh
osmosisd status --node=tcp://localhost:26657
```

3. Run any of the `osmosisd` commands against your LocalOsmosis network, as shown in the following example:

```sh
osmosisd query account osmo1l0jjmvdtj4c3f8cxzzgfhq0zhdzf2x8cgpg056
```

## Configure LocalOsmosis

The majority of LocalOsmosis is implemented through a `docker-compose.yml` file, making it easily customizable. You can use LocalOsmosis as a starting template point for setting up your own local Osmosis testnet with Docker containers.

Out of the box, LocalOsmosis comes preconfigured with opinionated settings such as:

- ports defined for RPC (26657) and LCD (1317)
- standard [accounts](#accounts)

### Modifying node configuration

You can modify the node configuration of your validator in the `config/config.toml` and `config/app.toml` files.

#### Pro tip: Speed Up Block Time

To decrease block time, edit the `[consensus]` parameters in the `config/config.toml` file, and specify your own values.

The following example configures all timeouts to `200ms`:

```diff
##### consensus configuration options #####
[consensus]

wal_file = "data/cs.wal/wal"
- timeout_propose = "3s"
- timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_prevote = "1s"
- timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_commit = "5s"
+ timeout_propose = "200ms"
+ timeout_propose_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_prevote = "200ms"
+ timeout_prevote_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_precommit_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_commit = "200ms"
```

Additionally, you can use the following single line to configure timeouts:

```sh
sed -E -i '/timeout_(propose|prevote|precommit|commit)/s/[0-9]+m?s/200ms/' config/config.toml
```

### Modifying genesis

You can change the `genesis.json` file by altering `config/genesis.json`. To load your changes, restart your LocalOsmosis.

## Accounts

LocalOsmosis is pre-configured with one validator and 10 accounts with ION and OSMO balances.

## Common issues

### Docker permissions problems

In case you get permission denied while trying to run `make start`

```
make start

Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

**Check that the docker engine is running:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If not:

```bash
# Configure Docker to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker.service

# Start docker service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

**Ensure that the current user is in the `docker` group:**

1. Create the docker group and add your user

```bash
# Create the docker group
sudo groupadd docker

# Add your user to the docker group.
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

2. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
